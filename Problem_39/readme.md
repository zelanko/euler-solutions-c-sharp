## Problem Text

If *p* is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, *{a, b, c}*, there are exactly three solutions for *p = 120*.

*{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}*

For which value of *p &le; 1000*, is the number of solutions maximised?

a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

sqrt(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>) = c
